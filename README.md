# Digit_Classification_Softmax
The MNIST dataset was used to train a neural network having a single linear layer with SoftMax employed in the criterion function (Cross Entropy Loss) to classify handwritten digits in classes 0 to 9. The model yielded a 92% accuracy on the MNIST test dataset in 10 training epochs.
